# Workflow-Basics
Students will be able to construct a basic data processing pipeline in a Jupyter notebook environment with Numpy, Tensorflow and Keras.   They will also be able to manipulate the tuning parameters of a deep learning model to adjust the learning process and performance of the algorithm.
