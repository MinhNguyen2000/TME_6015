# Assignment-2

## Objective
Run prediction (inference) using pre-trained models and dataset from Tensorflow, Huggingface and Kaggle.

## Deliverables
1. Create your own separate python notebooks in Colab for each of the three sources.
2. Display the results of the prediction results using a confusion matrix
3. Show a few examples of the predicted output
4. Choose one of the above examples (i.e. Tensorflow or Huggingface or Kaggle) and implement a 2 different models on the same test set
5. Compare the results between the models

## Submission Details
- Please save your final notebook to Github and be sure to check-in the changes to the main branch
- Break your notebook into small cells and add comments between the cells to describe your steps, decisions, and observations.
- Save your notebook after it is fully compiled so that the output is visible.
